# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses connection reliability and error handling issues in the Pepasur gaming application. The system currently experiences socket connection failures and API fetch errors that impact user experience during game creation and real-time interactions. This feature will implement robust error handling, connection recovery mechanisms, and user-friendly error messaging.

## Glossary

- **Socket_System**: The WebSocket connection management system using Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **API_Service**: The backend REST API service for game operations and data persistence
- **Game_Client**: The frontend React application that interacts with both Socket_System and API_Service
- **Connection_Manager**: The component responsible for managing and monitoring connection states
- **Error_Handler**: The system component that processes, logs, and displays connection errors to users
- **Recovery_Mechanism**: The automated system that attempts to restore failed connections

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want reliable socket connections so that I can participate in real-time game interactions without interruption

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Socket_System encounters a connection error, THE Connection_Manager SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. WHILE the Socket_System is disconnected, THE Game_Client SHALL display connection status to the user
3. IF the Socket_System fails to reconnect after 5 attempts, THEN THE Error_Handler SHALL display a user-friendly error message with manual retry option
4. THE Socket_System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
5. WHEN the Socket_System successfully reconnects, THE Game_Client SHALL automatically resume normal operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want API requests to handle failures gracefully so that I can retry failed operations without losing my progress

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API_Service request fails with a network error, THE Error_Handler SHALL display a retry button to the user
2. THE API_Service SHALL implement timeout handling for requests exceeding 10 seconds
3. IF the API_Service returns a 500 error, THEN THE Error_Handler SHALL display a server error message and suggest trying again later
4. WHILE an API_Service request is pending, THE Game_Client SHALL show loading indicators to prevent duplicate requests
5. THE API_Service SHALL validate environment configuration before making requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear feedback when connection issues occur so that I understand what's happening and what I can do about it

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL display connection status indicators in the user interface
2. WHEN connection errors occur, THE Error_Handler SHALL show specific error messages rather than generic failures
3. THE Game_Client SHALL provide actionable suggestions for resolving connection issues
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL distinguish between temporary network issues and configuration problems
5. WHILE connection recovery is in progress, THE Game_Client SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging so that I can diagnose and fix connection issues efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL log all connection errors with timestamps and error details
2. THE Socket_System SHALL capture and log connection attempt metadata including error types and transport information
3. THE API_Service SHALL log request failures with response status codes and error messages
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL provide structured error data for debugging purposes
5. THE Connection_Manager SHALL track connection statistics for monitoring purposes
