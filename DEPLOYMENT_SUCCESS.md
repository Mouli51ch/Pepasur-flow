## üéÆ How to Use the Contract

### 1. Create a Game

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');

// Setup
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org');
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  '0x54Fb33115B4b39A40A7267aEB69d2aBBA103Be1c',
  abi,
  wallet
);

// Create game: 1 FLOW stake, 4 min players
const tx = await contract.createGame(
  ethers.parseEther('1.0'),
  4,
  { value: ethers.parseEther('1.0') }
);

await tx.wait();
console.log('Game created! ID: 1');
```

### 2. Join a Game

```javascript
// Player joins game 1
const game = await contract.getGame(1);

const tx = await contract.joinGame(1, {
  value: game.stakeAmount
});

await tx.wait();
console.log('Joined game!');
```

### 3. Settle Game (Owner Only)

```javascript
// After game concludes off-chain
const winners = [
  '0xWinner1Address...',
  '0xWinner2Address...'
];

const tx = await contract.settleGame(1, winners);
await tx.wait();

console.log('Game settled! Winners can withdraw.');
```

### 4. Withdraw Rewards

```javascript
// Check pending withdrawal
const pending = await contract.getPendingWithdrawal(myAddress);
console.log('Pending:', ethers.formatEther(pending), 'FLOW');

// Withdraw
const tx = await contract.withdraw();
await tx.wait();

console.log('Withdrawn!');
```

## üîß Contract Functions

### Game Functions
- ‚úÖ `createGame(uint256 stakeAmount, uint8 minPlayers)` - Create and join game
- ‚úÖ `joinGame(uint64 gameId)` - Join existing game
- ‚úÖ `settleGame(uint64 gameId, address[] winners)` - Owner settles game
- ‚úÖ `withdraw()` - Claim pending rewards

### View Functions
- ‚úÖ `getGame(uint64 gameId)` - Get game details
- ‚úÖ `getPendingWithdrawal(address player)` - Check withdrawal balance
- ‚úÖ `getPlayers(uint64 gameId)` - Get all players in game
- ‚úÖ `owner()` - Get contract owner
- ‚úÖ `nextGameId()` - Get next game ID
- ‚úÖ `houseCutBps()` - Get house fee percentage

### Admin Functions (Owner Only)
- ‚úÖ `setHouseCut(uint16 newCutBps)` - Update house fee (max 10%)
- ‚úÖ `emergencyRefund(uint64 gameId)` - Refund all players
- ‚úÖ `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` - Transfer ownership

---

## üí∞ Game Economics

### Example: 4-Player Game

**Scenario:**
- 4 players each stake 1 FLOW
- Total pool: 4 FLOW
- House fee (2%): 0.08 FLOW
- Reward pool: 3.92 FLOW

**If 2 players win (Non-Mafia):**
- Each winner gets: 1.96 FLOW
- Profit per winner: 0.96 FLOW (96% profit!)
- Losers: Lose their 1 FLOW stake

**If 1 player wins (Mafia):**
- Winner gets: 3.92 FLOW
- Profit: 2.92 FLOW (292% profit!)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2: Backend Migration ‚úÖ Ready

**Files to modify:**
1. Create `backend/services/EvmServiceSimple.js`
2. Replace Aptos SDK calls with ethers.js
3. Update settlement logic (no signature needed, owner settles directly)
4. Copy `.env.flow` to `.env` when ready to use

**Key changes:**
- No signature verification needed (owner settles)
- Direct ethers.js contract calls
- Much simpler than full EIP-712 implementation

### Phase 3: Frontend Migration

**Files to modify:**
1. Replace Aptos wallet adapter with wagmi + RainbowKit
2. Add Flow EVM Testnet to wallet configuration
3. Create contract interaction hooks
4. Copy `.env.flow` to `.env` when ready to use

## üß™ Testing the Contract

### Quick Test Script

```javascript
// test-contract.js
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

async function testContract() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org');
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(
    '0x54Fb33115B4b39A40A7267aEB69d2aBBA103Be1c',
    abi,
    provider
  );

  // Test view functions
  const owner = await contract.owner();
  console.log('‚úÖ Owner:', owner);

  const nextGameId = await contract.nextGameId();
  console.log('‚úÖ Next Game ID:', nextGameId.toString());

  const houseCut = await contract.houseCutBps();
  console.log('‚úÖ House Cut:', houseCut.toString(), 'bps');

  console.log('\n‚úÖ Contract is working!');
}

testContract();
```

## üîê Security Notes

### Owner Responsibilities
‚ö†Ô∏è **The owner account can:**
- Settle any game
- Set house fee (max 10%)
- Emergency refund games
- Transfer ownership

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep owner private key secure!**
- Current owner: `0x798b32BDf86253060d598038b1D77C98C36881D6`
- Private key in: `contract-flow/.env`
- **NEVER commit this to git!**

### Trust Model
- Players trust owner to settle games fairly
- For trustless production, use full Pepasur contract with EIP-712 signatures
- PepasurSimple is best for:
  - Testing and development
  - MVPs and prototypes
  - Trusted environments

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Underpriced"
Increase gas price:
```javascript
{ gasPrice: ethers.parseUnits('2', 'gwei') }
```

### "Insufficient Funds"
Get more testnet FLOW: https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/

### "Incorrect Value"
Make sure `msg.value` matches `stakeAmount`:
```javascript
const game = await contract.getGame(gameId);
await contract.joinGame(gameId, { value: game.stakeAmount });
```

### "Not Owner"
Only the deployer wallet can call owner-only functions.
Current owner: `0x798b32BDf86253060d598038b1D77C98C36881D6`
